CodeReview #4 for Backend Developer Course@Codefactory Vienna
==================================================================

Task: As a Full Stack Web Developer you got your first full-stack project, the Big Library web application. 
      The customer wants you to create a big list of all media available in the library (books, CDs, DVDs) and make it available over the web.

The information that you will need to have in your DataBase is:

      Consider them as hints for the columns for the table:
          title, image (HTTP link to an image* or file name only), ISBN code, short_description, type (book, CD, DVD), author_ first_name, author_last_name, publisher_ name, publisher_address, publish_date.

*Feel free to choose if you would like to use:

    file uploader as in prework
    image name only and the images are already all available in a folder. You only need to make the reference in the DB.
